# User Access Feature
***
We intend to implement a feature for controlling user access to the products of the website. This feature should assess user access based on the following features and conditions.

### Acceptance Conditions
1. If a user is not logged into the website, they have no access rights to any product.
2. If a user has an inactive status, they have no access rights to any product.
3. User access to the requested product is only possible through a purchased subscription.
4. If a user has a subscription for a product but it has expired, the user does not have the right to access the product.
5. If a user's subscription is inactive, they do not have access to the desired product.
